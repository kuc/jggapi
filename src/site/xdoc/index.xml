		<section name="JGGApi - Gadu-Gadu protocol implementation.">
			<p> <b>JGGApi</b> is a Gadu-Gadu protocol implementation based on 
				specification from <b>EKG</b>. Gadu-Gadu is a very famous 
				Instant Messanger in Poland. </p>
			<p> Thanks to the libary it is very easy to create applications 
				that communicate with Gadu-Gadu server. It uses commonly used 
				design patterns (GoF) that minimizie the learnining curve for 
				developers. It has a good internal design and realizes a paradigm of 
				programming - <em>programming by extension</em>. 
				What is more, it will help developers that are 
				going to write applications similar to <b>Kadu</b>, <b>Gaim</b> 
				or command-line <b>EKG</b> to fasten their development process. 
				</p>
			<p> if you want to start using library and learn how to use it, 
				it is suggested that you take a look at our <a 
				href="guide.html">Getting Started</a> guide. </p>

		<section name="Releases">
			<p> There is an old version of the library that has already been 
				released. It is <b>jggapi-0.94</b> and you can download it here:
				<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=79198">jggapi-0.94</a>. 
				It works fine but it has limited functionality and does not 
				have a support for searching in public directory, loading and 
				storing information there and also it does not support contact 
				list at all. </p>
			<p> The new version of library <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=79198">jggapi-1.0-dev</a> has many 
				improvements and clearer design. It is not compatible with the 
				old version, interfaces have changed significantly but porting 
				from an old version should not be a difficult task. It also has 
				the support for features that are not available in previous 
				version. Note that this version has suffix <em>dev</em> because 
				it has not been tested extensively. It would be very 
				appreciated if users could provide feedback about the usage of 
				this library.
			</p>
			<p> 
				It is strongly recommended that you use the newest version 
				instead of an old one because support for 0.94 will no longer 
				be provided.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Features">
			<p> The version (1.0-dev) allows: <ul> <li>Sending and receiving 
				messages.</li> <li>Gives possibility to retrieve confirmation 
				of message delivery.</li> <li>Exporting and importing of the 
				user's contact list.</li> <li>Setting status and notification 
				of statuses that are changed by monitored users.</li> 
				<li>Ability to read and write personal information to the 
				public directory.</li> <li>Possibility to search public 
				directory based on user defined criteria.</li> </ul> </p>
		</section>
		<section name="Known Bugs">
			<ul>
				<li> The current version is not thread safe but the thread 
					safety check will be perfomed soon. </li>
				<li> Initial status that is set in <code>LoginContext</code> 
					does not work. At beginning we send <code>Login60</code> 
					packet but the Gadu-Gadu server is ignoring it. Therefore 
					we have to sent status packet after connecting. What is 
					more, it is known that this is also done by a standard 
					Gadu-Gadu client, i.e. <i>explicite</i> setting status. 
					</li>
				<li> Write support for larger contact lists. Current 
					implementation is limited to contact lists that are not 
					more than 2048 bytes long. </li>
				<li> Add ability to send larger notify lists, i.e. list that is 
					send at the beginning to notify Gadu-Gadu server what users 
					we want to monitor. </li>
				<li> The libary is not tested enough therefore adding JUnit 
					tests is of high importance. </li>
