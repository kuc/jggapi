	<section name="Frequently Asked Questions">
    
		<subsection name="What is JGGApi?">
		  <p>
		  The <b>JGGApi</b> is a Java Gadu-Gadu protocol implementation.
		  <b>JGGApi</b> uses that well-known design patterns that minimize learning curve.
		  As a result developers can write Gadu-Gadu clients faster than before.
		  </p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="What is the JGGApi license?">
		  <p>
			We use <b>GPL open source license</b>, therefore if you want to write the Gadu-Gadu client
			it must have <b>GPL license</b> as well.
			To find out more about open-source licenses point your browser at:
			<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">www.opensource.org/licenses/</a>
		  </p>
		</subsection>
	
		<subsection name="Who develops JGGApi?">
			<p>
			The project was founded by <a href="mailto:mnaglik@gazeta.pl">Marcin Naglik (mnaglik@gazeta.pl)</a>
			in 2003.
			</p>
			<p>
			In November 2004 <a href="mailto:mati@sz.home.pl">Mateusz Szczap (mati@sz.home.pl)</a>
			joined the project and helped with the development and documentation process.
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="What version of JVM (java virtual machine) can I use?">
			<p>
			The project was developed using JDK 1.4.2 but there should be no problem
			running with with 1.2, 1.3 virtual machine. However it was not tested against these.
			If anyone could report whether or not the library is compatible with 1.2 and 1.3 JVM it
			would be appreciated. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Due to nested classes it is definately not possible to use it with an old 1.1 java virtual machine.
			</p>
		</subsection>
		
		<subsection name="Who should use this library?">
			<p>
			This library can be used by anyone who wishes to write any kind of application
			or module that will interact with Gadu-Gadu server and it's users.
			</p>
			<p>
			For instance, client application can be written in SWT, Swing, or even an applet that
			can be displayed in web page. Writing a simple servlet as a web gateway to Gadu-Gadu
			is also possible. Also writing application as a command-line similiar to EKG should not
			be problematic.
			</p>
			<p>
			It is also possible that this library could become part of some CRM or workflow system
			implemented as a module that would allow interaction between some corporate system and
			IM users.
			</p>
			<p>
			What is more, it is possible to write some kind of bot that could chat with users, such as very
			famous <a href="http://www.alicebot.org/">Alice bot</a>.
			</p>
		</subsection>
		
		<subsection name="Is it legal to use this library?">
			<p>
			It is not since the company who developed Gadu-Gadu (SMS Express) states on their web page that
			people can connect to their server only from the clients authorized by this company. However,
			there are many open-source Gadu-Gadu applications that use this proprietary protocol, some of them
			available in official linux distrubutions such as <b>EKG</b>.
			</p>
		</subsection>	

		<subsection name="Is JGGApi better then libgadu from EKG project?">
			<p>
			Yes and no. <b>Libgadu</b> from <b>EKG</b> project is more tested since it has a huge open-source
			community feedback. The disadvantage of the <b>libgadu</b> is that it is written in c language and
			there are some porting issues. <b>JGGApi</b> is a library written in Java
			and will run on every computer that has <b>JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</b> installed.
			</p>
			<p>
			In addition, the <b>JGGApi</b> is an object-oriented library and has a clear design. 
			It should be relatively easy for a new developer to write a Gadu-Gadu application
			using this library.
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="I want to write a Gadu-Gadu midlet for my cell phone, can I use your library?">
			<p>
			Yes, you could use it but the library is quite big (>100 KB) and has not been optimized for J2ME
			virtual machine. Also it was not tested so please feel free to provide information about
			whether or not you succeeded.
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="How can I contribute to this project?">
			<p>
			If you are a Java developer that wants to write a Gadu-Gadu application you can
			help by submiting bug reports and patches fixing found issues.
			</p>
			<p>
			Also, there is a TODO list that always has some issues on it. Please feel free to look at
			it if you want to help us. If you convince us that you are valuable to the
			project and that you have Java skills we will be happy to include you on
			the list of our developers.
			</p>
			<p>
			You do not have to be a Java developer to contribute to this project or even
			a developer at all. Some aspects include writing documentation, maintaing this site
			and testing the current version of the <b>JGGApi</b> library.
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection name="Does JGGApi depend on any library?">
			<p>
			Yes, it depends on commons-logging framework that is a ultra-thin bridge
			to the logging implementation. 
			</p>
			<p>
			If you want to find out more about commons-logging framework take a look at:
			<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/</a>
			</p>
		</subsection>
	
		<subsection name="Where should I begin?">
			<p>
			First of all, you have to grab a fresh release of <b>JGGApi</b> from 
			<a href="releases/">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Second of all, please read our <a href="guide.html">Getting Started</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Third of all, your can browse JGGApi's <a href="apidocs/index.html">Java Docs</a> and
			<a href="xref/index.html">sources</a> online.
			</p>
			<p>
			Last but not least, start writing your application or module and get some hands on.
