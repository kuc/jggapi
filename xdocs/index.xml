        <section name="JGGApi - Gadu-Gadu protocol implementation.">
            <p>
			JGGApi is a Gadu-Gadu protocol implementation based on specification
			from EKG. Gadu-Gadu is a very famous Instant Messanger in Poland. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Thanks to the libary it is very easy to create applications
			that communicate with Gadu-Gadu server. It uses commonly used
			design patterns (GoF) that minimizie the learnining curve for
			developers that are going to contribute to this project. It has a
			good internal structure and realizes a paradigm of programming -  
			<em>programming by extension</em> not by modification. What is more,
			it will help developers that are going to write applications similar to Kadu, Gaim
			or command-line EKG to fasten their development process.
            </p>

		<section name="Releases">
			<p>
			There is an old version of the library that has already been released.
			It works fine but has limited functionality.
			</p>
			<p>
			Currently, we are preparing for the new release of the library (1.0) that has many improvements
			and clearer design. It is not compatible with the old version, interfaces have changed
			significantly but porting from old version should not be a difficult task.
			</p>

        <section name="Features">
            <p>
			The upcoming version (1.0) will allow:
				<ul>
					<li>Sending and receiving messages.</li>
					<li>Possibility to retrieve message delivery confirmation</li>
					<li>Exporting and importing of the contact list.</li>
					<li>Setting status and notification of user's changing status.</li>
					<li>Notification of changing statuses.</li>
					<li>Ability to read and write personal information to the public directory.</li>
					<li>Possibility to search public directory based on user defined criteria.</li>
				</ul>
            </p>

        <section name="Known Bugs">
			<ul>
				<li>
				The current version is not thread safe but the thread safety check will be perfomed soon.
				</li>
				<li>
				Initial status that is set in <code>LoginContext</code> does not work.
				At beginning we send <code>Login60</code> packet but the Gadu-Gadu server
				is ignoring it. Therefore we have to sent status packet after connecting.
				What is more, it is known that this is also done by a standard Gadu-Gadu client,
				i.e. <i>explicite</i> setting status.
				</li>
				<li>
				Write support for larger contact lists. Current implementation is limited to contact lists
				that are not more than 2040 bytes long.
				</li>
				<li>
				Add ability to send larger notify lists, i.e. list that is send at the beginning
				to notify Gadu-Gadu server what users we want to monitor.
				</li>
				<li>
				The libary is not tested enough therefore adding JUnit tests is of high importance.
				</li>
			</ul>
