            <p>
			JGGApi is a Gadu-Gadu protocol implementation based on specification
			from EKG. Thanks to it is very easy to create applications
			that communicate with Gadu-Gadu server. It uses commonly used
			design patterns (GoF) that minimizie the learnining curve for developers.

			There is an old version of the library that has already been released. It works fine but has
			limited functionality.
			</p>
			<p>
			Currently we are preparing for the new release of the library (1.) that has many improvements
			and clearer design. It is not compatible with the old version, interfaces have changed
			significantly but porting from old version should not be a difficult task.
